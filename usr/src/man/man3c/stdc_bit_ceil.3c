.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn stdc_bit_ceil
family of functions finds the smallest power of 2 that is not less than
.Fa value .
If the resulting value would not fit in the type, then 0 is returned.
For example, if one were to use
.Dv UINT8_MAX
with
.Fn stdc_bit_ceil_uc
the next power of two would be 0x100, which is larger than would fit in
an 8-bit unsigned char, resulting in 0.
.Pp
The
.Fn stdc_bit_ceil
function is generic and will operate on all 8, 16, 32, and 64-bit
unsigned integers; however, it is only available in C23.
The other functions all operate on a specific integer type, but
otherwise behave the same and are available regardless of the C language
version.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
The functions in the
.Fn stdc_bit_ceil
family returns the smallest power of 2 that is not less than
.Fa value .
These functions cannot fail.
.Sh EXAMPLES
.Sy Example 1
Printing the bit ceiling of an integer.
.Bd -literal
#include <stdbit.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <limits.h>

int
main(void)
{
	printf("0x%x 0x%x 0x%x 0x%llx\en",
	    stdc_bit_ceil_uc(0xd2),
	    stdc_bit_ceil_us(0x7777),
	    stdc_bit_ceil_ui(0x038fa0ff),
	    stdc_bit_ceil_ull(0));
	return (0);
}

When compiled and run, this produces:
