.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn stdc_bit_ceil
family of functions finds the smallest power of 2 that is not less than
.Fa value .
If the resulting value would not fit in the type, then 0 is returned.
For example, if one were to use UINT8_MAX with
.Fn stdc_bit_ceil_uc
the next power of two would be 0x100, which is larger than would fit in
an 8-bit unsigned char, resulting in 0.
.Pp
The
.Fn stdc_bit_ceil
function is generic and will operate on all 8, 16, 32, and 64-bit
unsigned integers; however, it is only available in C23.
The other functions all operate on a specific integer type, but
otherwise behave the same and are available regardless of the C language
version.
.Sh CONTEXT
These functions may be called from
.Sy user ,
.Sy kernel ,
or
.Sy interrupt
context.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
The functions in the
.Fn stdc_bit_ceil
family returns the smallest power of 2 that is not less than
.Fa value .
These functions cannot fail.
